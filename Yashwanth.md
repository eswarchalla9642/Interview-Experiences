As a student who applied for the job role at HCL through the on-campus recruitment drive, I'm thrilled to have been selected for a position within the company.
The entire journey, from attending the pre-placement talk to receiving the final offer letter, has been incredibly rewarding.

The written test challenged me to think critically and apply my knowledge across various domains, from aptitude to technical subjects.
Navigating through the coding round was both exhilarating and demanding, as I had to solve complex problems within a limited timeframe, showcasing my programming skills and problem-solving abilities.

The face-to-face interviews were the culmination of my efforts, where I had the opportunity to engage with HCL professionals and demonstrate my technical knowledge, communication skills, and enthusiasm for the role. 
It was a gratifying experience to discuss my projects, internships, and aspirations with industry experts, knowing that each interaction brought me closer to securing a position at HCL.

Being selected for a role at HCL is not just a validation of my academic and technical capabilities but also a testament to my determination and perseverance throughout the recruitment process. 
I'm eager to embark on this new journey with HCL, where I know I'll have the opportunity to grow professionally, contribute meaningfully to the company, and make a positive impact in the world of technology.
